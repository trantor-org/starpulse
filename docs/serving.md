# Serve and configure

## Serve

Open <http://localhost:8766>. The first serve creates `.starpulse/board/` in the working directory (beside the config file when `--config`
names one): a `config.yml`
holding the project name (that directory's name, the team its tasks are in), the lanes (To Do, In Progress, Done) and an empty `tasks/` directory, one Markdown file per task. The
Kanban view starts with no tasks: **New task**, at the top right beside the task count, opens a form for its title, description, priority, labels,
milestone, assignee, dependencies and acceptance criteria and adds it to the first column, and
**Connect a tracker** opens a modal with one collapsible row per tracker (the native board, Backlog.md, Jira), each expanding to
numbered setup steps whose commands copy with one click (see [Connect a tracker](#connect-a-tracker)). If the directory has a Backlog.md project (`backlog/config.yml`), serve prints one
line naming it and the `starpulse connect backlog` command that shows it instead; the page's
snapshot carries the same line as `hint`, and Connect a tracker shows it with the command as a copyable block. StarPulse keeps its event log and history in
`starpulse-history.sqlite` beside its config file, or in the working directory without one. The page has no sign-in and listens on this machine only (`127.0.0.1`): `--host 0.0.0.0` widens it to
every interface so another computer on your network can open it, which you do only on a network you trust. A write (move, edit,
start, run, history window) is refused unless it is a JSON request (`Content-Type: application/json`) that either names no
`Origin`, as a script or `curl` does, or names this server's own, so a web page on another site cannot write through your browser.

`starpulse serve --port 8800 --hours 24` changes the port and how far back a task's latest move counts toward
where it is drawn (6 hours by default). The Admin page's Server card overrides that window for everyone
viewing, and `starpulse-settings.json` beside the config keeps the override across restarts.

## Config file

`starpulse serve --config starpulse.toml` reads one TOML file; `starpulse.toml` in the working directory is read
when it exists. Database credentials never go in it: they come from the driver's environment, such as `PGPASSWORD`.

The default SQLite store must be on a local disk because WAL mode does not work on network filesystems such as NFS
or SMB. When the project or config lives on network storage, set `database_url` to a Postgres database instead.

```toml
# The tracker's web address: a task links to `<tracker_url>/tasks/<id>`. Unset, it opens in the page's own Kanban.
tracker_url = "https://tracker.example.com"

# History in Postgres instead of SQLite; install the extra with `uvx --from 'starpulse[postgres]' starpulse serve`.
database_url = "postgresql+psycopg://db.example.com/starpulse"

# How long `serve` keeps the event log's rows: it prunes older ones at start and hourly, so the table, a SQLite file
# and every reader's replay at boot stay bounded. A reader that was down longer than this resumes at the oldest kept
# row and records the span it missed in `starpulse_gaps`. A whole number of days, 1 or more.
event_log_retention_days = 7   # the default

# Where `serve` writes each row it prunes, before it deletes the row (see Event log archive): a directory, relative to
# this file unless absolute. A `serve --hub` prunes no rows and writes no archive.
event_log_archive_dir = "starpulse-archive"   # the default

# The board adapter: a module under `starpulse`, or the dotted path of one an installed package provides.
# The rest of the table is that adapter's settings.
# With no [board] table the view draws its own Markdown board, `type = "native"`:
[board]
type = "native"
# path = ".starpulse/board"  # the board's directory, relative to this file; created empty when absent
# machine = "board.yaml"     # a machine file for the Board: its transitions and `writers` decide which moves are offered, and to whom
# criteria = "my-evaluator {id}"  # evaluates a task's Start Criteria; {id} is the task's id (see docs/adapters.md)

# To draw a Backlog.md project instead:
# [board]
# type = "upstream_backlog"
# path = "backlog"       # the project's backlog/ directory, relative to this file
# command = "backlog"    # the upstream Backlog.md CLI (`npm i -g backlog.md`) that writes a move (`backlog task edit <id> -s <status>`); a fork of it that lacks `backlog init` is not it
# machine = "board.yaml" # as above

# To draw a Jira project instead (read-only; building the board reads the site once, to import the workflow):
# [board]
# type = "jira"
# url = "https://example.atlassian.net"  # the site, http or https
# project = "PAY"                        # the Jira project key, which is each task's team
# workflow = "Payments Software Workflow" # the Jira workflow imported as the Board machine
# token_env = "JIRA_TOKEN"               # the environment variable holding the token: Bearer, or with `user` the Basic password
# user = "ada@example.com"               # Jira Cloud: the account the API token belongs to
# interval = 30                          # seconds between polls

# Draw each task's pull-request CI as a sub-flow of these Board states: StarPulse ships one `ci` machine, which GitHub
# moves and StarPulse only observes (its `source` is GitHub). Each name is a Board state id; one the Board lacks is refused.
# With `gh` available, each task with a PR is one agent in that flow, and its trail is the PR's pushes, check results,
# re-runs, conflicts, rebases and merge, read from GitHub every minute and kept in the event log (`machine:events`).
# [ci]
# states = ["in_progress", "review"]

# One instance of a runs adapter, a module under `starpulse` or the dotted path of one an installed package provides

```

## Autopilot

The autopilot is a switch, a capacity reading and an admission rule; no loop acts on the rule yet. The switch is persisted in
`starpulse-autopilot.json` beside the config file (in the working directory with none), so it survives a restart, and it starts off.

`GET /api/autopilot` answers any address:

```json
{"enabled": false, "sampledAt": 1788307200.5, "dimensions": [{"name": "cpu", "use": 35.0, "limit": 80.0}]}
```

`dimensions` lists `cpu`, `memory`, `sessions` and `review` in that order, each as its use against its limit.
`sampledAt` is epoch seconds, and `dimensions` is empty with `sampledAt` null until the first sample.

- `cpu` and `memory` are the host's busy share and used share, in percent, read from `/proc`.
- `sessions` counts the tasks with an active harness session.
- `review` sums the `size-N` labels of the tasks in `review_lane`; a task without one counts `unsized_points`.

`PUT /api/autopilot` with `{"enabled": true}` or `{"enabled": false}` sets the switch and answers the same body. It
answers only loopback and private-network (RFC 1918) addresses, with 403 elsewhere, and like every write it needs
`Content-Type: application/json`. A `serve` that runs no autopilot, an adapter-kit server, answers 404.

The sampler reads every 60 seconds. The first sample is a baseline; after it, a dimension going from below its limit
to at or over it, or back, logs one `StarPulse autopilot: <dimension> is full|free (<use> of <limit>)` line.

### Admission

`autopilot.admission.decide` answers, for each workable task in the eligible lane, whether it fits and where it ranks. It is
a pure function of the open tasks, the sampler's readings, the `[autopilot]` policy, the trajectory chain and the run ledger.

- **Demand.** A task draws `size points x its tier's weight` percent of CPU and of memory, one session, and its points of
  review. The tier is the middle word of its profile (`@agent-standard-high` is `standard`); a tier with no weight, or no
  profile, prices at the dearest weight. Once 3 runs of the same tier and size are in the ledger, their mean peak replaces
  that prior.
- **Fit.** A task is admitted only if its demand is at most the headroom (limit less use) on every dimension; otherwise
  the decision names the first dimension it overfits.
- **Order.** The admitted tasks go in the order of critical-path depth, the task itself plus the longest chain of open
  tasks waiting on it. In shadow, the default, a second order is only logged: `value / dominant share`, where value is depth
  times P(goal) and dominant share is the largest `demand / limit` over the dimensions. P(goal) is the chain's
  `p_goal` for the lane (`trajectory_analytics(...)["chain"]`), and 1 when the lane has no history. An optional predictor, a
  function from a task's title and description to a score, replaces P(goal) in that shadow value and is logged; a
  predictor that raises leaves the score empty.
- **Log.** Each decision logs one line:
  `StarPulse autopilot: <task> admitted|refused (<dimension> full) p_goal=<p> predictor=<score> shadow_rank=<n> enforced_rank=<n>`.
  Ranks number the admitted tasks from 1; a refused task has none.

The run ledger, `starpulse-autopilot-runs.jsonl` beside the switch, holds one JSON line per finished run: its task, tier,
points, outcome, duration in seconds and the peak demand it drew on each dimension.

## Event log archive

Before `serve` deletes an event-log row it appends the row to a gzip JSONL file under `event_log_archive_dir`, one
file per UTC day of the row's `at`, named `YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl.gz`. A later pass that prunes more of a day appends to that
day's file, which is then several gzip members in a row; `gzip` and DuckDB read them as one stream. A pass writes and
fsyncs a batch of rows, 1000 at most, before it deletes that batch, so a write that fails (disk full, directory not
writable) deletes nothing and logs the failure, and the next hourly pass retries. A crash between the write and the
delete archives those rows again, so a reader of the archive keys a row on `id`.

Each line is one JSON object with every column of `starpulse_events`:

```json
{"id":1,"stream":"machine:events","event_id":"evt-1","fields":{"machine":"m","event":"A"},"at":1788307200.5}
```

`at` is seconds since the epoch. Read a day with DuckDB, or with the standard library:

```sql
SELECT id, stream, event_id, fields, to_timestamp("at") AS at FROM read_json('starpulse-archive/*.jsonl.gz');
```

```python
import gzip, json

with gzip.open("starpulse-archive/2026-09-01.jsonl.gz", "rt") as lines:
    rows = [json.loads(line) for line in lines]
```

## The Ledger

A Board event a machine's `cues` name or that a workflow writes (`writers`) is *tied* to that workflow. The snapshot's
`ledgers` (and the `ledgers` event after it) list, per tied event, each occurrence newest first with the run of every
tied workflow that answered it: `{key, at, tasks, runs}`, and for the `MERGED` event `sha` and `pr` (`{repo, number, url}`)
too. A run is `{runId, status, startedAt, finishedAt, steps, step, inferred, ambiguous}`: its status, its status per
step, and the step it is in.

- `MERGED` occurrences are merged pull requests, which carry their tasks, from the last day. Any other event's are tasks
  entering the lane the event reaches within the last day.
- The snapshot's `ledgers.MERGED` holds only the newest 20 merges (a page); `GET /api/merges?before=<at>&limit=20` returns
  the next older page as `{merges, more}`, `before` being the `at` of the last row held. Rows sharing the boundary second
  come together, so a page can run past `limit` and walking it neither repeats nor skips a merge; none is older than 24
  hours. `mergeStrip` (snapshot, and with `ledgers` in the `ledgers` event; null with no workflow tied to `MERGED`)
  counts the whole day without the rows: `{since, bucket, buckets}`, 96 buckets of 900 seconds from `since`, each
  `{merges, failed, reruns}`: merges landed, those holding a failed run, and forced reruns started (a run whose
  `[runs.commit]` `force` parameter is set and not `0` or `false`). `mergePins` (same two carriers) lists the pinned
  merges of the last day that the newest page leaves out, so a failure waiting on its cue is never paged out of sight.
- A run whose parameters name an occurrence under `[runs.commit]` (`after` for a merge's commit, a full or abbreviated
  sha; `task` for a task) pairs with it and is not `inferred`. A run that names an occurrence StarPulse does not hold pairs
  with nothing.
- Any other run of a tied workflow pairs with the newest occurrence before it started and is `inferred`; its `ambiguous`
  counts the older occurrences that landed since the workflow's previous run, any of which it may equally be for. Of several
  inferred runs for one occurrence the earliest wins, and a keyed run outranks them.
- A workflow's `recent` runs (`Dag.recent`, the last day's, with their parameters) are read from Dagu for tied workflows
  only, and are left out of the `dags` the page draws.
- A failed run of a cued workflow *pins* its occurrence: the row carries `fails` (`{<instance>/<workflow>: {runId, step,
  startedAt, finishedAt, resolves, resolved}}`) and `pinned` while any failure is open. The cue's `resolves` decides the
  clearing run, which must have started after the failure and succeeded: `next`, any such run of that workflow; `forced`,
  one whose `[runs.commit]` `force` parameter is set (not empty, `0` or `false`) and which covers the failure, naming no
  commit or task or an occurrence at least as new (a commit the Ledger does not hold covers nothing). A failure is
  tracked apart from the run drawn for the occurrence, so a green plain retry of the same commit does not clear a
  forced failure. A cue with no `resolves` rule, or an event no cue names, takes `next`. An instance with no `force`
  key never clears a forced failure.
- `POST /api/runs/<instance>/<workflow>/rerun` starts a run-safe workflow with `force` set to `1` and the `after`,
  `before` and `task` parameters of its newest open failure, through the runs adapter's optional `rerun(url)` (the
  Dagu adapter offers it). It answers `{runId}`; 409 when the instance declares no `force` or the workflow has no open
  failure; 404 for a workflow outside `run_safe`; 403 off the LAN. A GET answers 405.
- A pin lasts as long as StarPulse can still read the failed run: the last day of Dagu runs (`recent`) and the window of
  merged pull requests and lane entries. An older failure drops out of the Ledger and cannot be rerun here.
- A `[[repos]]` entry names a repository whose merges apply through the parent's pin bump. Its `MERGED` rows take no run
  and carry `appliedBy`: the `key` of the first later merge in another repository whose submodule pointer at `path`
  contains the merge's commit (read through `gh`), or `null` while no such merge exists. That merge's row lists what it
  applies in `applies`. A pin bump appears only when a task cites its pull request.

## Machine rows

The machines entered from an open machine (the In Progress one at the top) are its rows, newest activity first: a row is
as recent as the newest task of the machine and every machine nested below it, ties break by name, and a machine with no
task comes last. The snapshot's `flows` carries every machine; `machinePage` (`{open, machines, more}`) names the In
Progress machine's first 20 rows. `GET /api/machines?open=<machine>&before=<last>&limit=20` returns the next page of any
level as `{open, machines, more}`, each machine whole as a `flows` entry with its derivation. `open` defaults to the In
Progress machine, `before` is the `last` of the last row held (0 for a machine with no task), and `limit` runs 1 to 100.
Rows sharing the boundary activity come together, so a page can run past `limit` and walking it neither repeats nor skips
a machine. An unknown `open` is 404; a `before` that is not a finite number or a `limit` out of range is 400.

`machineStrip` (`{entries}`) lists every machine entry of the 24 hours before the snapshot's `now`, without the rows, oldest first, as
`{at, machine, row, from, dag}`: `row` is the machine on the In Progress level the entry lands on, so an entry into a
nested machine counts on the row above it; `from` is the `{machine, state}` the task's session was entered from (null
when no earlier session is known); `dag` is the workflow that launched a session with no task.

The page scrolls the rows under the fixed top by the wheel, Page Up and Page Down, the arrow keys, Home and End and a
draggable thumb, with `↑ back to newest` once scrolled; the rows are drawn only while in view. As the footer comes
into view it loads the next 20 older machines from `/api/machines`. The 24 h strip under the rows draws a tick per
entry, coloured by the state it was entered from (amber for a workflow launch), shades the rows in view as one
stretch, and a click on a tick scrolls to its row. A click on a state of the top scrolls to the first machine it
opens and picks it out; Escape steps back from the card, then the picked row, then the scroll to newest. A click on a task pins it and narrows the rows and the strip to
the machines it holds a session in (`N machines holding <task>`); closing its card restores every row. A demo page (`?demo`) takes `&many=N` to grow the machines under
the In Progress one to N, enough to scroll.

## Connect a tracker

`starpulse connect` checks that a tracker answers, then writes the `[board]` table of `starpulse.toml` for you, keeping
every other table and comment. It prints one line saying what it read. A tracker that does not answer writes nothing,
says why on stderr and exits 1; `--config` names another file, and `starpulse connect <tracker> --help` lists each
tracker's flags.

```sh
starpulse connect native --path .starpulse/board --machine board.yaml   # StarPulse's own board; --path and --machine are optional
starpulse connect backlog --path backlog                                # a Backlog.md project; --command names its CLI
